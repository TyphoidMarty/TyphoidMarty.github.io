  <h1>Great Britain</h1>
  <p>Great Britain is an island in the northwest part of Europe. It is the biggest island on the continent, located
    just off the shore of France, west of the Netherlands, and north of Spain.</p>
  <p>Great Britain is part of the sovereign state called the United Kingdom, and contains three of its four countries:
    England, Scotland, and Wales. England, the biggest part of the island, is in the southeast, and its capital city is
    London, which is also the capital of the United Kingdom. Scotland is to the north of England, and its capital is
    Edinburgh. Wales is to the west of England, and its capital is Cardiff.</p>
  <p>Great Britain is not the name of the country itself. Many people call the UK 'England' or "Great Britain", and
    British people who do not live in these areas may not like it if other people make this mistake.</p>
