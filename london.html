    was also called Lunnainn in Scottish Gaelic,[10] Llundain in Welsh and Londain in Irish.</p>
  <p>For a long time, London was a small city. All its people lived inside the walls that were built by the Romans.
    This area is still called the City of London. There were many villages around the city. Gradually, more people came
    to live there. Then, step by step, the villages joined together into one huge city.</p>
